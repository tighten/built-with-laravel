                This is a manually curated list of companies and organizations using Laravel, with an emphasis on
                showing
                <em>real-life</em>
                projects, not just developer-focused tools and sites. Our goal isn't to get as many sites in here as
                possible; it's to show people who are unsure about Laravel what it can be used for.
